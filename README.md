Very tiny MP3 player for _my_ needs. Mostly an excuse for me to learn how
to use termbox (after being inspired by Brandon Rhode's [talk on terminal animations](https://youtu.be/rrMnmLyYjU8)),
as well as how to write my own UI loop. Start it up in a directory where
there are MP3 files, and `orchid` will do the rest:

    $ git clone https://github.com/eugene-eeo/orchid
    $ cd orchid
    $ make install
    $ cd totally-legit-music
    $ orchid -h

Ideally ran in a terminal with size 50x8; you could run it on something
larger, but it doesn't respond to larger/smaller sizes. You'll need a
terminal with true-colour support (see iTerm on OSX) for the album art
to display properly.
