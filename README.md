# orchid

Very tiny music player for my needs. Mostly an excuse for me to learn how
to use termbox after being inspired by Brandon Rhode's [talk on terminal animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrMnmLyYjU8).
Start it up in a directory where there are MP3 files, and `orchid` will
do the rest:

    $ go get -u github.com/eugene-eeo/orchid
    $ cd totally-legit-music
    $ orchid

Ideally ran in a terminal with size 50x10 (you could run it on something larger,
but it doesn't respond to larger/smaller sizes) and with the excellent [Iosevka Term](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)
font, although Envy Code R works as well. Note on OSX: for some reason images
are only properly displayed on screen-256 (at least for me). YMMV.
